                <h2>PORTFOLIO</h2>
                <p>All of these images were captured by me to show my perspective of old st.louis. My intention of doing urbex was to just live on the edge and do crazy stuff but soon I realized it was a lot bigger than that. The history of St.Louis was disappearing in front of my eyes and I know at that point my partner and I had a mission to preserve as many buildings as we could with our camera gear. It was a race against the city demo crew. This is my story as an Urban Explorer through my cameras perspective. </p>

                  <h3>Southern Funeral Home</h3>
                  <p>For nearly 90 years, the Southern Funeral Home was a fixture on South Grand just north of Holly Hills Boulevard -- a Spanish Revival building in a city more inclined to Victorians and the Beaux-Arts. But by 2015, the building had been vacant for five years, and the city's Preservation Review Board gave its permission to a developer seeking demolition.</p>

                        <h3>Cleveland High School</h3>
                        <p>This property features a large, historic building with approximately half of the acreage undeveloped -- an incredible opportunity for a mixed-use redevelopment along Grand Avenue. The school was designed by W.B. Ittner and named for U.S. President Grover Cleveland.</p>

                  <p>This was a photograph of the massive auditorium. It reminded me of my old high school. There were many times you felt like something or someone was watching you. You would leave a roomn and as soon as you did it sounded like people were actively moving around.</p>

                        <p>St. Augustine rose on the city's north side in 1896; it stands west of the Hyde Park neighborhood at Lismore and Hebert. The stout Gothic building was constructed to serve a German congregation. It ceased operation as a Catholic church in 1979 and passed to the Christ Baptist Church in the early 1980s. </p>
